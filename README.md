Federated Learning (FL) has demonstrated significant potential in the field of Remote Sensing (RS) by enabling collaborative training of distributed models while preserving data privacy. However, the inherent data heterogeneity in RS, caused by variations in geographic regions, sensor types, and image resolutions, poses substantial challenges to model performance and convergence. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as an effective solution to address data heterogeneity by tailoring models to the unique data distributions of individual clients. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on optimizing internal clients, and their generalization capabilities often degrade significantly when deployed to external clients with unknown data distributions. This limitation is particularly pronounced in RS due to the complex and diverse nature of its data.To overcome this limitation, we propose FedOP (Outside-Client Personalization for Federated Learning), a novel framework that enhances outside-client personalization through a dynamic routing mechanism. Clients adopt a local adaptation strategy that combines global and local gradients, significantly reducing training time without compromising accuracy. More importantly, FedOP constructs a flexible routing space by integrating personalized and global models, enabling adaptive path selection based on input features. Therefore, we design a novel unsupervised learning scheme that further optimizes path combinations through loss minimization and pseudo-labeling, enabling lightweight updates to improve adaptability to unseen clients.Extensive experiments on remote sensing image segmentation demonstrate that FedOP achieves superior outside-client personalization performance and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly on unseen clients with diverse data distributions outside the federated training environment.# FedOP
